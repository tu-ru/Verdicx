The court distinguished this from the identification of a stranger, citing precedent that recognition is more reassuring.

The court applied the 'Turnbull' guidelines for assessing identification evidence, especially from a single witness, and emphasized the higher reliability of 'recognition' over 'identification of a stranger' as established in 'Anjononi & Others vs. Republic'. The principle from 'Oyier' was used to confirm that consent obtained through fear or duress is invalid. Finally, the principles from 'Wanjema v. Republic' were used to assess the appropriateness of the sentence, concluding that there was no basis to interfere with the trial court's discretion.\", \"keyPrecedentsCited\": [ { \"precedentName\": \"Okono vs. Republic [1972] EA 74\", \"precedentSummary\": \"Establishes the duty of a first appellate court to reconsider and re-evaluate evidence to arrive at its own independent conclusions.\" }, { \"precedentName\": \"R –vs- Turnbull & Others (1973) 3 ALL ER 549\", \"precedentSummary\": \"Sets out factors to consider when evidence turns on identification by a single witness, emphasizing caution.\" }, { \"precedentName\": \"Anjononi & Others vs. Republic [1980] KLR 59\", \"precedentSummary\": \"States that recognition of a known assailant is more satisfactory and reliable than the identification of a stranger.\" }, {"
